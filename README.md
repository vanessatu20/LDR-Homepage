# LDR_app

A new Flutter project.

## Branching Rules

use initials (e.g. working on home screen)
- feature/HL-homescreen (for feature development)
- bugfix/HL-homescreen (for bugfixes)

once you complete a feature, make a PR into develop
- master --> everything should be working in this branch and reviewed / tested by someone else on the teams
- develop --> when you first complete a feature, make a pull request into develop
